# SGJ19-Schinken

In this 2D Jump N’ Run game you play Kyui, a little child of the fridgecarrier tribe. 
The tribe is nature loving and thus vegetarian, but Kyui loves his ham, which he always carries with him in his fridge. 
One day he discovered the mushrooms are evil and now Kyui is on a journey to prove it to the tribe. 
He stomps the evil mushrooms with the fridge Kyui hides in or fights against them with his frozen ham. 
But careful! When the ham cools down you can’t use it as a weapon anymore!

In this game we combined 3D character animations with 2D backgrounds. The beautiful art and harmony in the game got us the 3rd place at the winter Semestergamejam 2019!
